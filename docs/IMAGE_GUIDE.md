# Image Guide for Interactive Dark Matter Detection

## Recommended Image Types

For best results with the interactive dark matter detection feature, use images that show:

### ✅ Best Options:

1. **Galaxy Field Images**
   - Images showing multiple galaxies in a field
   - Examples: Hubble Deep Field, galaxy cluster images
   - Format: JPG, PNG
   - Resolution: 800x600 to 2000x1500 pixels works well

2. **Astronomical Survey Images**
   - SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey) images
   - DES (Dark Energy Survey) images
   - Any wide-field astronomy images with multiple galaxies

3. **Simulated Galaxy Grids**
   - Computer-generated galaxy distributions
   - Dark matter simulation visualizations
   - Any image showing a grid/array of galaxies

### 📸 Where to Find Images:

**Free Astronomy Image Sources:**
- **NASA Image Gallery**: https://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/imagegallery/
- **Hubble Space Telescope**: https://hubblesite.org/images
- **ESA Hubble**: https://esahubble.org/images/
- **SDSS SkyServer**: http://skyserver.sdss.org/
- **Unsplash**: Search for "galaxy", "space", "astronomy"

**Example Search Terms:**
- "galaxy cluster"
- "deep field"
- "galaxy field"
- "astronomical survey"
- "gravitational lensing"

### 🎯 What Makes a Good Image:

1. **Multiple Galaxies Visible**
   - At least 10-20 galaxies in the image
   - Clear, distinct galaxy shapes

2. **Good Contrast**
   - Galaxies stand out from background
   - Not too dark or too bright

3. **Reasonable Resolution**
   - 800x600 minimum
   - Up to 2000x1500 recommended
   - Larger images may be slow to process

4. **Clear Galaxy Shapes**
   - Elliptical or spiral galaxies visible
   - Can distinguish individual galaxies

### ⚠️ What to Avoid:

- Single galaxy images (need multiple galaxies)
- Very low resolution images (< 400x300)
- Images that are mostly black space
- Images with heavy image compression artifacts
- Very large images (> 5MB may be slow)

### 💡 Tips:

1. **Start Simple**: Use a clear galaxy field image with 20-50 galaxies
2. **Mark Strategically**: Click on galaxies that appear distorted (gravitational lensing effect)
3. **Use Both Modes**: Mark some as dark matter (red) and some as background (blue)
4. **Compare Results**: See how your markings compare to model predictions

### 🔬 How It Works:

The feature extracts ellipticity-like features from the image brightness around your marked points. In a real implementation, you would use proper galaxy shape analysis, but for demonstration purposes, it simulates features based on:
- Image brightness around marked points
- Pixel intensity patterns
- Spatial relationships

The model then predicts dark matter presence based on these features, similar to how gravitational lensing analysis works in real astronomy.
