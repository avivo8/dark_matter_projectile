## What I Fixed:

✅ Fixed all image paths to work with GitHub Pages  
✅ Copied visualization images to the website folder  
✅ Everything is ready to deploy!

## Need Help?

If images don't show up:
- Wait a few more minutes (GitHub needs time to build)
- Clear your browser cache
- Check that you selected `/website` as the folder
